                Bun cha is one northern Vietnamese food that quickly became our favorite. It is one of the best Hanoi food specialties not to be missed.
                Bun Cha consists of grilled pork strips and balls or chả served over a bed of steaming rice vermicelli noodles or bún. The vermicelli noodles served on the side are thin, soft and slightly chewy.

                Nem Cua Be or crab spring rolls are the perfect complement to bun cha. It is a fried roll filled with sea crab and vermicelli noodles. 
                While Nem Cua Be is native from Haiphong, a city on the coastline of northeast Vietnam, it is common to see it served with bun cha in Hanoi.

                Fish soup is a common Vietnamese dish across Vietnam. The type of fish used is based on where you are in Vietnam.
                In Northern Vietnam, freshwater fish is widely used in dishes. This Hanoi food, bun ca, is no exception.
                It is a light broth made from fish bones with golden fresh white fish lightly fried. At the bottom of the soup you will find a bed of rice vermicelli.
